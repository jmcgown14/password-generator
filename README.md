# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

I modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.
They will be able to choose a set of charaters that they would like within a certain amount of characters allowed.
They will easily be able to follow the prompts to decie which characters they want in their password.
The password is then dispay in the password box on the screen once they have finished their prompts.
